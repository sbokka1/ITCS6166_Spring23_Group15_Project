### WebRTC+Streamlit:

We are using Streamlit to develop the UI of our project and WebRTC is used to provide the real-time video communication. The two libraries for this purpose are streamlit and stream-webrtc.

## The commands to install python libraries required to have this setup are:
•	Pip install Streamlit

•	Pip install streamlit-webrtc

After studying about streamlit and webrtc protocol, we locally tried multiple bits and pieces of code to get hold of the structure and development environment. Finally we were able to develop a streamlit webpage that consists of two windows which are enabled with camera and microphone, and these can in future be modified to create a real-time call scenario. The webpage also consists of an option where user can chose the talking head.

## Instructions to run the application:
•	Navigate to the folder where the application resides.

•	To run the application, use the syntax: “streamlit run filename.py”

The above shown image is our initial attempt towards the UI of the project and it will be further developed in coming iterations. The code file corresponding to the above page is attached in the GitHub.
