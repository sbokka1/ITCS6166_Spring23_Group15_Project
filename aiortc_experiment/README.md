# Experimenting with aiortc
I used aiortc repo: https://github.com/aiortc/aiortc to learn to understand how WebRTC works and tinker with its internals.
# What is aiortc?
aiortc is a Python library that enables developers to implement WebRTC and ORTC protocols, which are used for real-time communication between web browsers and other devices. Unlike other existing implementations of WebRTC and ORTC, aiortc provides Python bindings and is more flexible, allowing developers to integrate their own audio or video processing algorithms into their applications. This makes aiortc a valuable tool for developers who prefer Python as their primary language and want to create custom real-time communication applications.
