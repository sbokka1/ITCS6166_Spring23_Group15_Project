### Project Title:- 
#### Video Call Application(WebRTC) with audio driven talking head generation.
### Introduction:-
#### The project is centred around a video call, where we capture the audio of the caller(sender) and transmit over to the receiver where the face of the caller is transitioned to the animated character or a hero.While the audio of the caller remains the same.The key benefits of above transition are as follows:the privacy of the callers is protected as we are changing the face of callers to well-know characters.Thereby, the identity of users can be withheld with utmost security. Secondly, the disturbances that occur due to poor network connection can be avoided as we are transmitting only audio.This is because audio transmission requires less bandwidth when compared video transmission.
### Architecture:-
#### We are planning to build a web application so we will be using Client-Server Architecture.
### Next Two Weeks Project Plan
Every Software project is implemented step by step using a SDLC model. We are adapting the agile methodology to implement our project. Based on the agile methodology we are going to work on our project by dividing the tasks into sprints. We are planning to have a sprint review meeting at the end of each sprint, to discuss what are the action items or tasks that must be done in the next sprint and also split the tasks among ourselves. Each sprint may last around 2 weeks.

Requirements Gathering:
Requirements Gathering is a crucial phase where we are going to understand the  requirements, objectives and the outcomes that must be achieved from this project. Based on this we get the functional and non-functional requirements for our project. A prior literature survey is important, so we are going to go through all the related resources and get valuable insights from them that will be useful for us to implement our project.

Designing Phase:
Based on the requirements we are going to develop a basic design or sketch of the project. The design consists of flow charts, basic UI sketch, architecture, model, and other components to are to be used. Once we are done with designs we proceed to the development/implementation.
